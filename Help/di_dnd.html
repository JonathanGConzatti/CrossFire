The Drag &amp; Drop capability of DeckIt! is quite powerful (due mainly to constant feature requests from some beta testers).
<H3>Adding Cards</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The most common usage of drag &amp; drop adding is to drag a card from the selection list to the deck.
But, you can do much more than that!
You can drag from the <A HREF="se_main.html">ultra searcher</A>
 or <A HREF="di_differ.html">deck differ</A> results lists to the deck as well.
<P>
Drag &amp; drop adding of cards also works across multiple DeckIt! windows!
You can drag from any card selection list, ultra searcher or deck differ results lists to any deck box.
<P>
For example, suppose there are two DeckIt! windows open.
One window has a deck with your favorite realms in it and the other is has one you are just building.
Simply drag the Realm heading from one and drop it in the deck of the other...all of the realms will be added!

<H3>Removing Cards</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Drag &amp; drop removal of cards only works on the the DeckIt! that the drag started on.
To remove a card drag it from the deck to the card selection list.
You can also remove an entire card type by dragging the card type heading to the card selection list.

<H3>Overview:</H3>
The Ultra Searcher was created to allow for very precise card searches.
For example: you wanted to find all undead monsters or all Greyhawk realms
with the word "immune" in the card text.
These kinds of searches can now be done!
<H3>Searching:</H3>
Each part of the Ultra Searcher dialog has a check box.
Select that check box to limit the search to what is selected
in the lists or entered in the fields.
The items in a list are OR (not AND) searches!
(ie: selecting Flyer, Awnshegh, and Swimmer will match any of those.)
Caution: &lt;Clear&gt; clears the entire form.
You can add cards from the results box to a deck by draging and dropping the card onto the deck list.
<H3>Fields:</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>Card Title and Text</B>
<DD>Enter plain text or a regular expression. This text is NOT case sensitive.
<P><DT><B>Levels</B>
<DD>The level field is entered as a list of levels to search for.
It also allows for ranges of levels such as 2-5, or &lt;5 or &gt;8.
These may be combined: <CODE>&lt;4, 7, 8, 10-12</CODE>.
This will find all levels less than 4 or equal to 7, 8, 10, 11, or 12.
<P><DT><B>Last Digit</B>
<DD>Select the desired last digit of the card number.
Ranges can be specified the same way as "Levels" above.
<P><DT><B>Attributes, Card Types and Worlds</B>
<DD>Select the desired criteria from the list.
</DL>
<H3>Example:</H3>
<OL>
<LI>All Undead Monsters:
<OL>
<LI>Push &lt;Clear&gt;
<LI>Click Attributes
<LI>Select Undead
<LI>Click Card Types
<LI>Select Monster
<LI>Click &lt;Search&gt;
</OL>
<LI>All Greyhawk realms with the word "immune" in the card text:
<OL>
<LI>Push &lt;Clear&gt;
<LI>Click Card Text
<LI>Type 'immune' into the entry field. (This is NOT case sensitive.)
<LI>Click Card Types
<LI>Select Realm
<LI>Click Card Worlds
<LI>Select Greyhawk
<LI>Click &lt;Search&gt;
</OL>
This was to (hopefully) find the realms that were immune to something
or inferred immunity to champions.  A better text to type might be "immun".
</OL>

Restore allows you to recover back ups of your Decks, Inventories, Combos, and Trades.
<P>
As each file is restored, its color will change from black to:
<UL>
<LI>blue - successfully restored.
<LI>purple - file was unchanged since the back up.
<LI>green - the current version is newer than the back up.
<LI>red - appears to be a CrossFire file, but the type is unknown.
</UL>

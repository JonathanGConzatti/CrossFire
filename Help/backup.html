Back Up allows you to save a copy of your Decks, Inventories, Combos, Trades, and Fan Sets into another directory.
<P>
On the configuration window, you can enable automatic back ups to occur after a specified number of days.
<P>
As each file is backed up, its color will change from black to blue to indicate that it was successfully backed up.
If there is a problem with backing up the file, you will be notified and the file(s) will remain black.

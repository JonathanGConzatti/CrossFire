<HR><P>
The CrossFire Card Warehouse is used to keep an inventory of your Spellfire collection.
<P>
The inventory made with this can be exported to David Maxey's Spellfire Database 2.x.
Importing from Spellfire Database 2.x is also available.
<P><HR><P>
There are four main areas of Card Warehouse:
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="cw_menu.html"><H3>The Menu Bar</H3></A>
<LI><H3>Card Selection List</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The card selection list contains all of the cards of the selected card set.
The card set can be changed from the <A HREF="cw_menu.html">menu bar</A> or by pressing the comma (,) or period (.) key.
<P>
You can search for a card with the search box below the selection box.
Simply enter the word (case insensitive) to search for.
To repeat the search, press or &lt;PageUp&gt; or &lt;PageDn&gt; to search backwards or forwards, respectively.
<P>
You may use the keyboard to "navigate" through the selection list.
The &lt;Home&gt;, &lt;End&gt;, &lt;Up&gt;, &lt;Down&gt;, &lt;PageUp&gt;, and &lt;PageDn&gt; keys work as expected.
Pressing the &lt;RightArrow&gt; key will increase the "On Hand" quantity and
the &lt;LeftArrow&gt; will decrease the "On Hand" quantity.
<P>
Many cards can be changed at one time. Pressing &lt;Control-A&gt; will select all cards.
&lt;Control-Left-click&gt; will toggle a card's selection and &lt;Shift-Left-click&gt; will
select all cards from the last card clicked to the current.  All selected cards will be
changed when the "Premium Card" status, "Max Wanted", or "On Hand" is changed.

<P><DT><B>Deck Format</B>
<DD>Changes the format of deck.
The standard 55, 75, and 110 card decks are supported.
Additionally, an 'Unlimited' deck is supported.
This deck type is mainly used to pick many cards that *may* be used in a deck and then editting down to a standard deck type.

The default is a 55 card deck.

<HR><P>
The Fan Set Editor is used to edit the cards in a fan created set.
<P><HR><P>
There are four main areas of the Fan Set Editor:
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="ce_menu.html"><H3>The Menu Bar</H3></A>
<LI><H3>Author Name and Email</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This shows the author's name and email address.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI><H3>Card Selection List</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The card selection list contains all the cards in the set.
While you can edit any of the fan cards, obviously the intent of this
editor is for editing the set you created!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI><H3>The Card Editor</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This displays the selected card for editing.<BR>
Some general notes to follow:
<UL>
<LI>Be logical. ie: Don't create an Avatar Artifact, etc.
<LI>Enter bonuses exactly as they should appear. ie: +3/+6, +?, -2, 5/7.
<LI>Include "No limit per deck." in the card text for unlimited copies of the card.
<LI>Include "Limit x per deck." to allow x number of copies. ex: Limit 3 per deck.
</UL>

The CrossFire DeckIt! Deck Editor is used to create and modify decks.
It tries to follow all deck constuction rules.
The standard deck sizes of 55, 75, 110 cards are supported.
Additionally, an "unlimited" size is provided mainly for adding all the cards that may be in the deck and latter trimming down to a legal size.
Other deck sizes can be created...email me for infomation on this.
<P><HR><P>
There are three main areas of DeckIt!:
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="di_menu.html"><H3>The Menu Bar</H3></A>
<LI><H3>Card Selection List</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The card selection list contains all of the cards that match the requested card set and type.
The card set and type can be changed from the <A HREF="di_menu.html">menu bar</A>.
Additionally, the card set can be changed by pressing the comma (,) or period (.) key.
<P>
You can search for a card with the search box below the selection box.
Simply enter the word (case insensitive) to search for.
To repeat the search, press or &lt;PageUp&gt; or &lt;PageDn&gt; to search backwards or forwards, respectively.
Pressing &lt;Enter&gt; will <A HREF="di_add.html">add</A> the card to the deck.
<P>
You may use the keyboard to "navigate" through the selection list.
The &lt;Home&gt;, &lt;End&gt;, &lt;Up&gt;, &lt;Down&gt;, &lt;PageUp&gt;, and &lt;PageDn&gt; keys work as expected.
Pressing the &lt;RightArrow&gt; key will <A HREF="di_add.html">add</A> the card.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI><H3>The Deck</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This displays the current deck, divided up by card type.
The numbers after the card type heading are the number in the deck and the maximum allowed.
Double clicking the heading will toggle the display of that card type.
The realm heading will be displayed in <FONT COLOR=red>red</FONT> if the minimum number of realms is not yet met.
<P>
The total number of cards and champion levels are displayed below the deck.
Your "free" avatar (which will be the highest leveled avatar), will be colored in <FONT COLOR=green>green</FONT> and it's levels will not be included in the total levels.
Note that the Dungeon card will NOT be included in the total number of cards.
For more detailed deck information, see the <A HREF="di_status.html">Deck Status</A> utility.
<P>
You may use the keyboard to navigate through the deck as well.
The &lt;Home&gt;, &lt;End&gt;, &lt;Up&gt;, &lt;Down&gt;, &lt;PageUp&gt;, and &lt;PageDn&gt; keys work as expected.
Pressing the &lt;RightArrow&gt; key will <A HREF="di_remove.html">remove</A> the card.

<H1>Crossfire Online Chat</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR><P>
The CrossFire online allows CrossFire users to chat with each other.
In the future, this will be the place to find someone to play an online
game with and we will periodically hold online tournments.

<H3>Sending Messages</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Just type in your message and press &lt;return&gt; or push the "Send" button.
This will send your message to everyone in your Realm.
You can enable time stamps to messages by selecting the "Time Stamp" option on
the chat menu.
<P>
To whisper to someone, type in the message, click on their name in the 
Ally or Champion list to highlight it, then push the Whisper button.
Alternatively, you may type &lt;control-return&gt; to whisper to them.
This will send to the selected user even if he/she is not in your realm.
Whispers will be underlined to distinguish them from normal messages.
<P>
The colors of each Champion's messages may be customized.
To customize their name and text colors, double-click their name in either the Ally list or Champion list.
Changes to the colors will be saved in your configuration for future chat sessions.

(ie: #bonk JoeUser).

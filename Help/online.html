<H1>CrossFire's Online Spellfire</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR><P>
CrossFire's Online Spellfire is designed to allow people to play Spellfire over the internet.
Since Spellfire is the greatest multi-player CCG in the world, it seemed silly not to support mulit-player...so it does!
Online play was the original goal of CrossFire and about 3 years later it is a reality.
Of course, this does NOT mark the end of CrossFire's development!
Online play and CrossFire in general will grow, improve, and change as it is used.
This has been a long and fun-filled journey for the developers of CrossFire and we hope you enjoy playing online.

<H3>Starting a Game</H3>
Before you start a new game <B>create a seperate realm</B> on chat to play in!
The online play tends to be a little "noisy" with all the messages that are sent.
Then follow these steps to get started:
<OL>
<LI>From the Chat interface, select Game -&gt; Spellfire.
<LI>Click on the name of your opponent in the Ally list in Chat.
<LI>Select Game -&gt; Add Opponent on the Online Spellfire Game window.
<LI>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each additional opponent.
<LI>Wait for all the other players to perform the same steps on their computer.
<LI>After all players are ready, open your deck with Game -&gt; Open Deck.
<LI>Select Deck -&gt; Cut to cut the deck to determine who starts.
</OL>

A note about Fan Cards.
Yes, you can use fan cards in online play, but you must be sure everyone else has the set installed.
Upon opening your deck, it will be scanned for fan cards and alert the others if you are using them.

<P>
If you open your deck before everyone is ready, wait until they are ready and then select Game -&gt; Restart.
This will clear your window and reload your deck.
<P>
You can add a player after a game has begun if so desired.
To add someone, do steps 2 and 3 above for them.
Have the new player do the above start up.
Finally, each person who has been in the game needs to do Game -&gt; Refresh Opponents.
This will update your formation for all of your opponents.

<P><HR>
<H3>The Online Play Interfaces</H3>
There are numerous windows for online play.
While each window will fit on a 640x480 screen, you will probably want a higher resolution.
<OL>
<LI>Your formation with optional auto-update card viewer.
<LI>A formation for each opponent (with optional auto-update card viewer).
<LI>The Panes of War.
<LI>The Game Notes.
</OL>
The Panes of War is the area for combat to occur.
It is also the general purpose card play area.
Use if for playing events and other cards that you play, but do not really belong in your area.
You can also transfer cards to another player by dropping the card on their war pane.
This is for cards like Fear that are placed on an opponent's champion.
In the rare event that an opponent is disconnected while a transfer is occuring, you can redo the transfer.
Cards that are transfered are sent out of play for the transfering player.
Double-click the Out of Play area and a list of cards that are out of play will be shown.
The card can be brought back into play by dragging it from that box.
A very noticeable message will be displayed when doing this.

<P>
The Game Notes window is for placing messages that others need to remember throughout the game.
The can be added with Note -&gt; New and removed with Note -&gt; Remove -&gt; title.
You can only remove the notes you post.

<P>
If you want to have more than one card displayed per window, you can right-click on any card to create a seperate window of that card.
This is especially helpful during combat.

<B>Game Discussions</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
During a game, you are bound to need to discuss the game.
This is done, of course, with the chat window.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Drawing Cards</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Click on the "Draw" button below the hand box or press Ctrl-D to draw a card.
The auto-update card viewer will display the drawn card and it will be highlighted in the hand display.
To draw mutliple cards quickly, right-click on the draw button for a pop-up menu.
This menu allows you to draw up to 8 cards at once.
A message of how many cards you drew will be sent to the chat window.
If your deck is empty, the discards will be shuffled and sent to the deck.
If you have no discards either, you will not be able to draw any cards.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Moving Cards</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Moving cards has been implemented with a simple drag-and-drop style interface.
Drag-and-drop is not a part of Tcl/Tk, so I had to create my own.
It is possible that one could attempt to move cards too fast for it to keep up.
If this happens it will politely ask you to slow down and the card may be in an unexpected location.
The cursor will change to a target when the drag has started and change back to the pointer when finished.
If you do not want to drag a card, be sure to wait until the cursor changes back before moving.
Cards moving when you do not expect them to is a symptom of you not waiting the 0.1 seconds it needs!
<P>
You can basically drag a card from anywhere to anywhere else.
To move a champion and his attachments, drag the champion (the attachments will follow automatically).
Some simple checking is implemented such as you can only place a realm on a realm target.
The view of your formation on your opponents' computers will automatically update as you move cards.

<P>
<B>Realms</B>: Realms are dropped onto the bisque colored label, not the box below.
The box below is for realm attachments, such as holdings, several artifacts, etc.

<P>
<B>Pool</B>: Adding to the pool is slightly different than the other boxes.
To add a champion, simply drag and drop it in the pool box.
To attach a card to another, drop the attachment onto the card to attach it to.
Attachments will be indented below the card.
You can detach a card by dragging that card to somewhere else.
If you need to place a non-champion in the pool but NOT attached to a champion, drop it on some blank space in the box or onto another card's attachment.
This is for cards such as Obsidian Man acting as a champion.

<P>
<B>Panes of War</B>: The Panes of War behaves the same as the pool.

<P>
<B>Out of Play</B>: As it states, dropping a card here will permanently remove that card from play.
The removed card will be displayed in the chat window.

<P>
<B>Deck</B>: This target allows you to place a card on the top of the deck (draw pile).
Used for returning your spoils to the deck, etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Raze / Unraze Realms</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can raze a realm by right-clicking on the realm name and selecting raze.
Once razed, the pop-up menu will change to unraze so you can unraze it later.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Phase Buttons</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The phase buttons are included on the interface for your convenience.
They do not change the operation of online play in any way.
These will probably be used more in the future especially if we have an online tournament.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Finishing Your Turn</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Press the "Knock" button or press Ctrl-K to knock and signal the end of your turn.
Be sure to always use the Knock button to end your turn!!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Just In Case...</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Unfortunately, someone could get disconnected from the internet while playing a game.
If this happens, everyone should stop moving cards!
After the dropped player returns to the game (the windows will stay), every player should do Game -&gt; Refresh Opponents.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Events normally go to the Abyss when discarded.
However, there are cards that allow them to go to the discard pile.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

I Wish that one of them there cards would go away!
Since the pool is hidden, you need a method to target a random card.
This is done with Pool -&gt; Pick Random Card.
The selected card will be revealed only to the player with the hidden pool.
This is because the targeted card could be immune to the effects.
A message will be displayed in the chat window when a random card is picked.

<H3>Overview:</H3>
Deck Differ gets its name from the Unix utility 'diff' which displays the differences between two files.
Deck Differ shows which cards are either shared by two decks or are unique to each deck.
<H3>Diffing:</H3>
Select the two decks.
The decks will automatically be re-diffed when the "diff type" is changed or one of the deck file names are changed.
ie: from Shared to Unique or vice-versa.
Cards may be added to the deck by drag and drop, double-clicking, or the &lt;RightArrow&gt; key.
